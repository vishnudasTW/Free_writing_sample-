## Introduction 

 Recycling is the process of breaking down used products and rebuilding something new or
value-added products from them. In today’s world, we follow the use and throw away culture,
spreading packaging wastes everywhere. Many plastic materials like covers, toothbrushes, bottles are
single-use products, thrown away into the trash after use. The fact is that it will take many years to
decay the plastic waste and decompose it into the soil. To make our planet green and pollution-free,
we should need to follow effective recycling methods as a daily practice.

The best way to diminish the waste production curve is to follow the 3 R’s. The first step is to
**reduce** the usage of single-use materials. These are the materials that can be used one time, later
on, it is considered as waste products. The next step is to promote the **reuse** of materials such as
metal or glass bottles. These bottles will last long more time compared to single-use plastic bottles.
The last and effective step is **recycling**. Here the waste products are converted into value-added
products by minimizing the waste generation. Thus, new products are evolved from waste materials.

## Benefits of recycling
The major benefits of recycling are:
* Conservation of natural resources.
* Reduction in amount of waste produced.
* Prevention of over usage of resources.

## Conclusion 
Recycling is the best method to reduce pollution and global warming. All citizens should
follow effective waste management procedures to minimize the waste contribution. Follow the rule
of 3 R’s for effective waste management.
